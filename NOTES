CODE PLANS (what i NEED to do):
-make the tamagotchi object.
-add hunger, play, and sick functions for the tamagotchi
-learn how to track time


CHARACTER PLANS:

1: Egg 
2: Child (2 variations)
3: Teen (2 variations dependent on which one)
4: Adult (4 variations)



GAME FUNCTIONS (what it NEEDS to do):

-Start Game (game is revolved around time, since thats how it grows)

-Two meters that detect Happyness, and Hunger. (feed to releave hunger, play to make happy. if hungry and not happy it could get sick)

-when sick will have squiggles coming up(hard to explain)

-Have an egg state where it sits and waits to hatch (faster then original tamagotchi - 5 min top (randomized)) 

-When egg spawns it has two random options it could be (2 baby states)

-A pooping function where the tamagotchi will randomly poop and fill the space(if poop stays for too long tamagotchi will get sick)


-A cleaning function that will clean all poop

-A health function where it will fill the health bar when pressed(but it will get less happy when u do it)

-A mini game to increase the happy meter, (will be the minigame where you try to guess what way the tamagotchi will be facing(Left or Right - randomized 50/50 chance))

-A feed function where you choose a meal or snack (meal increases the hunger bar more then the snack will(Wont be able to eat meal when full- cannot over feed with snacks))

-A sick button
